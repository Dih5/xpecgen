# Summary

X-rays tubes are widely used nowadays in medical applications, specially in medical imaging and radiation dosimetry, as
well in other areas like security scanning or food contaminant irradiation. `xpecgen` is a program designed as a research
and educational tool for use in medical applications by non-programming experts, as well as providing and API for
programmers. It may also be of interest in other areas of knowledge where x-ray tubes are used.


`xpecgen` is a python package to calculate x-ray spectra generated in tungsten anodes using the model of Hern치ndez and
Fern치ndez (@hernandez:2016). It includes a Graphical User Interface and allows calculation of half-value-layers, norms,
and attenuation. It can also export the calculations in XLSX and CSV formats.
