This folder contains files describing electron penetration in tungsten.
The origin of the data is the set of FLUKA simulations by Hernández&Fernández.
The tabulation done here is done with the numerical interpolations described in that article.
-Grid.csv
	First line: Depth in units of the csda range (x)
	Second line: Fraction of kinetic energy retained by the electron (u)
-E0.csv
	Matrix of differential fluence in arbitrary units depending on:
		-Row: x (units of the csda range)
		-Column: u
