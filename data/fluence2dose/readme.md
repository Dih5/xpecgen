This folder contains files describing fluence to dose conversion
The origin of the data is H. E. Johns and J. R. Cunningham, The Physics of Radiology.
This tabulation is based on the one included in TASMICS. Units are changed and the multiplicative factor is the inverse of the one found there
Note that the dose depends on the fluence and just not on the spectrum, that's why units of area appear in the conversion factor.
One can also think of the magnitude calculated with this factor as an absolute dose in Gy and understand the photon spectrum is a fluence distribution given in 1/keV/cm^2
